        PROBLEM STATEMENT: <br>
        RATES OF SEA LEVEL RISE, CHANGE IN CURRENTS, CORAL BLEACHING, OCEAN ACIDIFICATION, AND MARINE HEATWAVES ARE INCREASING BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AS A RESULT OF HUMAN ACTIONS, DRASTICALLY CHANGING THE LIVES OF OCEAN LIFE AND HUMANS ALIKE.
      </p>
      <p>
        NEED STATEMENT: <br>
        AS A RESULT OF THIS ISSUE, HUMANS, ESPECIALLY LARGE CORPORATIONS, NEED TO MINIMIZE THEIR CARBON AND ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT IN ORDER TO RETURN THE EARTH BACK TO A NORMAL STATE WITH HEALTHY LEVELS OF GREENHOUSE GASES.
      </p>
      <p>
        EVIDENCE: <br>
        "Latest estimates from the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization warn that more than half of the world’s marine species may stand on the brink of extinction by 2100. At a 1.1°C  increase in temperature today, an estimated 60 percent of the world's marine ecosystems have already been degraded or are being used unsustainably. A warming of 1.5°C threatens to destroy 70 to 90 percent of coral reefs, and a 2°C increase means a nearly 100 percent loss - a point of no return." (United Nations) <br>
        Stats show that if humans don't make active life changes to combat climate change soon, in less than 80 years, a majority of ocean life will near extinction. <br> <br>
       
        "Together with intensifying tropical cyclones, sea-level rise has exacerbated extreme events such as deadly storm surges and coastal hazards such as flooding, erosion and landslides, which are now projected to occur at least once a year in many locations. Such events occurred once per century historically." (United Nations) <br>
        The United Nations claims that climate change leads to sea-level rise. As a result, dangerous natural disasters occur much more frequesntly than before.
